# Savoury Shrubs - a resource for Plant Foraging

Foraging is a resourceful and sustainable way to find food but is not normalized. It can be difficult to gather information on what is safe to eat which is why we created Savoury Shrubs.

There are an innumerable number of plants that you can find in your own backyard which are safe and healthy to eat, but this knowledge is often forgotten or lost.

Our collaborative helps individuals on their quest to find local and safe sources of food near them, and provide information of how to harvest when they can find them including recipes.
